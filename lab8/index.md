## Lab #8: Deep Brain Stimulation Case Study

#### Deep Brain Stimulation Background

Deep brain stimulation is an FDA-approved treatment for Parkinson's disease and essential
tremors. As the name implies, DBS therapy involves the implantation of electrodes into
structures deep in the brain ("deep" as opposed to surface or non-invasive transcranial
stimulation, and "brain" as opposed to stimulation of peripheral nerves). As shown in the
picture to the left, A DBS system comprises to elements - the electrodes which are implanted
into the brain and deliver charge to the tissue, and the "implanted pulse generator" (IPG)
which contains a battery and generates and controls the stimulation pulses.  In this course, we
have been studying the implementation of small, low power embedded systems. An IPG is an
excellent example of a very specialized embedded system which must be both small and ulta-low
power. The goal of this lab is for you to learn more about devices which interface with the
nervous system and to consider the design of an IPG.

If you are interested in learning more about DBS, a good review is [Oluigbo et al, _IEEE
Reviews in Bioengineering_ 2012][Oluigbo2012.pdf]. If you are interested in learning more about
the mechanisms of DBS in Parkinson's disease, a good review is [Johnson et al,
_NeuroTherapeutics_ 2008](Johnson2008.pdf).

#### Exercises (10 pts each)
<ol class="questions">
<li>
Read this <a href="Moore2006.pdf">IEEE Spectrum article from 2006</a>. What are two stimulation therapies
that are FDA approved for treating depression. What are two other therapies that are being
tested for efficacy in depressed patients (as of 2006 - note that AFAIK, these tests are
on-going).</li>
<li>
Read this <a href="Denison2015">IEEE Spectrum article from 2015</a> for background. To treat
seizures, Company A and Company B both have systems which control stimulation in "closed loop",
i.e., in response to some detected signature. Assume the Company A system is measuring
variability in heartrate, and the Company B system is measuring the spectral power in a "local
field potential" rhythm with a center frequency of ~30 Hz. Which system do you think requires
more power for data acquisition and why? Which system do you think requires more power for
signal processing? Which system do you think will have lower latency?
</li>
<li>
Let's try to reverse engineer the power consumption of a commercial IPG. For this and the next
question, make reference to <a href"MedtronicIPGManual.pdf">this programming manual
for some of the Medtronic IPGs</a>. Look at the energy use data in Table 13 (for the Kinetra
system from Medtronic). If the device consumes some ammount of constant power (due to digital
blocks) plus some amount of variable power depending on stimulation intensity, we would expect
the increase in energy consumption with increasing stimulation current and pulse width to rise
with a slope of approximately one. Is that what you observe? Why might this not be the case?
</li>
<li>
Some dystonias are treated with DBS at 40 Hz rather than the standard 130 Hz for Parkinson's
disease. What would you expect the difference in battery life to be between the two conditions
for a Kinetra stimulator set to 5 mA stimulation and 60 us pulse widths (continuous
stimulation)?

#### Design Study (40 pts)

Below is the schematic for a simple MSP430-based system for delivering constant-current
stimulation (i.e., an IPG). Your task is to evaluate the design using your knowledge of the
MSP430 and by reading the data sheets for the two other integrated circuits, the [current-mode
digital to analog converter (DS4432)](DS4432.pdf) and the [digitally-controlled switch
(TS3A4751)](TS3A4751.pdf).

The goal of the IPG is to deliver biphasic current pulses (with each phase 60 Î¼s in duration)
with a programmable frequency and current amplitude. The   Outline the structure of code that would
