## Lab #8: Programming Simon

#### Part 1: Populate your Simon PCB

Solder up your Simon PCBs.

#### Part 2: Code up the game

We will create a game that follows a variant in which the pattern to be remembered is generated
by adding one element each cycle. The player then has some amount of time ("the timeout
period") to correctly enter the pattern. If they fail to enter it in time or enter an incorrect
pattern, the device plays a "Game Over - Lost" animation. If the player is able to remember a
maximum number of elements ("maximum sequence size"), the device plays a "Game Over - Won"
animation. The "Game Over" animations should play in a continuous loop. However, after a few
seconds, pressing any button should start the game over.

Details:
- On initial boot, the devices should play either one of the "Game Over" animations or a third
  novel animation. Pushing any button should then start the game.
- Sequences should be random each game.
- When a button is pressed, the appropriate LED should flash (and tone should sound).
- The timeout period should not be a constant. Rather, each time a player pushes a button, a
  new timeout should start. Thus, a timeout of 1-2 s is appropriate.
- Errors should result in immediate game over (i.e., button presses should be processed
  immediately).
- You should make the maximum sequence size adjustable. For your video, sequences of length 5
  are appropriate.

**Save this code as `simon.c`. Create a demo video that shows you playing through to a win,
running the "Game Over - Win" animation, and then pushing a button to restart and then playing
through but making a mistake to generate the "Game Over - Loss" animation. Upload your answered
questions, code and the video URL to owlspace.**
