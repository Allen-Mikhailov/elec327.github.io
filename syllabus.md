**Lab Office Hours:**
  - See [Piazza](piazza.com/rice/spring2020/elec327/home)

Additional Lab office hours may be requested on Piazza or by email

**Text Book:** There is no text book, but you will need to purchase a solderless breadboard for
prototyping. A smaller one is fine, but a larger one (such as
[this
one](https://www.amazon.com/Circuit-Test-MB-106-Breadboard-175x230mm-Holes/dp/B008MOLEGK/)) may
be easier to use. Furthermore, you should take care of the MSP430 Launchpad you will be given.

**Class Hours:** Wednesday 3:30 -- 6 PM DH1046/AL124/DH1020
Our plan for this semester will be to start with a brief lecture and then work on labs each week during
official class hours.  Students are expected to spend significant out-of-class time (~10 hours
per week) working on lab assignments.

**Lab Help Sessions:** See Lab Assistant hours or by request on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/jqprx90wr5220s) or through email  
Help sessions held in lab room A124

**Course website:**  
We use 2 different digital resources:

1. The primary location assignments and lecture notes (and other resources) is the course
website â€“ [http://elec327.github.io](http://elec327.github.io)
2. We use Canvas ([https://canvas.rice.edu/courses/30233](https://canvas.rice.edu/courses/30233))
for announcements and for communication. If you have specific questions about course content or
assignments, please post them on Canvas. As a corollary, you may find it useful to check for
answers as questions arise.
3. We additionally use Canvas for assignment submission and for posting rubrics for peer-grading.

**Course Description:** One of the most critical aspects of modern computer systems involves
interfacing with the world. This course will focus on how power-efficient user-facing systems
are built.

**Objective:** Students should learn the fundamentals of embedded system programming and feel
competent to design, build, and manufacture their own embedded devices. &nbsp;Furthermore,
students should understand how embedded systems interface with external peripheral devices.
Students should understand how application-specific blocks enable modern commercial devices.
Finally, students should understand how to design and build their own embedded systems
including printed-circuit board design and assembly.

**Outcome:** Students completing the course should be able to:

1. Identify the key blocks in an embedded system
2. Utilize software tools to program embedded devices
3. Design and implement a real-time sensor processing system
4. Utilize software tools to design printed circuit boards
5. Assemble functional integrated systems

**Prerequisites:** ELEC 220. Also useful are 240 and 241.

**Grading:** Grades will be based on: approximately eight lab modules (60%), a midterm project
(15% each), a final project (30%), as well as extra credit options. Late assignments may be
accepted (with penalty), except for printed circuit board orders , where late submissions may
not be accepted. Students wishing to submit late assignments should contact the instructor
prior to the due date.

**Honor code:**  You are encouraged to work **with** other students in ELEC327 on the labs. Each
student should turn in their own lab writeup (except for midterm and final project, which
should be done in pairs). I would like you to write your own code and (especially) comments for
the labs.

**Required Textbooks and Supplies:**

No textbook is required. Students will be provided with one MSP430-G2553
Launchpad and an associated "Sidekick" kit which contains a solderless breadboard
and jumper wires. More jumpers will be available in lab. It is recommended
that students procure a larger solderless breadboard - they can be purchased,
for example, on Amazon for $30-40.

**Lab Cleanliness:**

Historically, the lab space has not been maintained in a neat and orderly manner.
Starting in 2017, we will implement spot inspections and **class-wide grade
deductions** to try to ensure that a high quality working and learning environment
is maintained.

**Waste:** In the process of learning how to assemble (i.e., solder) surface mount devices,
there has been not-insignificant waste, where things end up on the floor. While
we would prefer to avoid artificially limiting students supplies, we will do so
if waste is not contained.
