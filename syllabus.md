**Class Hours:** Tuesday, Thursday 9:25-10:50 Room AL 121 (subject to change)  
Note – after spring break lectures will shift to about once per week. Students are expected to spend significant out-of-class time (~10 hours per week) working on lab assignments.

**Lab Help Sessions:** See Lab Assistant hours or by request on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/ijk6s504wdz2uw) or through email  
Help sessions held in lab room A124

**Course website:**  
We use 3 different digital resources:

1. The primary location assignments and lecture notes (and other resources) is the course
website – [http://elec327.github.io](http://elec327.github.io)
2. We use Piazza ([http://piazza.com](http://piazza.com)) for announcements and for
   communication. If you have specific questions about course content or assignments, please post
   them on Piazza. As a corollary, you may find it useful to check for answers as questions
   arise.
3. We use Owlspace for assignment submission and for posting rubrics for peer-grading.

**Course Description:** One of the most critical aspects of modern computer systems involves interfacing with the world. This course will focus on how power-efficient user-facing systems are built.

**Objective:** Students should learn the fundamentals of embedded system programming and feel
competent to design, build, and manufacture their own embedded devices. &nbsp;Furthermore,
students should understand how embedded systems interface with external peripheral devices.
Students should understand how application-specific blocks enable modern commercial devices.
Finally, students should understand how to design and build their own embedded systems
including printed-circuit board design and assembly.

**Outcome:** Students completing the course should be able to:

1. Identify the key blocks in an embedded system
2. Utilize software tools to program embedded devices
3. Design and implement a real-time sensor processing system
4. Utilize software tools to design printed circuit boards
5. Assemble functional integrated systems

**Prerequisites:** ELEC 220. Also useful are 240 and 241.

**Grading:** Grades will be based on: approximately eight lab modules (60%), a midterm project
(15% each), and a final project (25%). Late assignments may be accepted (with penalty), except
for printed circuit board orders , where late submissions may not be accepted. Students wishing
to submit late assignments should contact the instructor prior to the due date.

**Honor code:**  You are encouraged to work **with** other students in ELEC327 on the labs. Each
student should turn in their own lab writeup (except for midterm and final project, which
should be done in pairs). I would like you to write your own code and (especially) comments for
the labs.
