### Logistics

#### Lecture Times
Official Class will be held  MW 2-3:15 PM O'Connor Bldg for Eng and Sci Room 130 (Lectures and Lab). Typically
Mondays will be a lecture and Wednesdays will be a working lab period. **Note!** Students are expected to spend significant 
out-of-class time (~10 hours per week) working on lab assignments!

#### Course Communication
We will use Canvas Discussions for communication. ([2025 Canvas Link ](https://canvas.rice.edu/courses/76035))

### Course Materials 

#### Required Textbooks and Supplies

  - _Introduction to Embedded Systems Using the MSPM0+_ by Jonathan Valvano. 
    Available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C9SB2QQ9) for $19.95. 
  - Ebook version (thanks Prof. Valvano!) here: [https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/mspm0/ebook/index.htm](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/mspm0/ebook/index.htm)
  - In addition, you all will be given a MSPM0+ Launchpad. _Please care for it!_
  - A large solderless breadboard may be useful for prototyping. Prototyping jumpers 
     will be available in lab. A larger solderless breadboard can be purchased,
     for example, on Amazon for $30-40.


#### Course websites
1. The primary location assignments and lecture notes (and other resources) is the course
website â€“ [http://elec327.github.io](http://elec327.github.io)
2. We use Canvas ([https://canvas.rice.edu/courses/76035](https://canvas.rice.edu/courses/76035))
for announcements and for communication. If you have specific questions about course content or
assignments, please post them on Canvas. As a corollary, you may find it useful to check for
answers as questions arise.
3. We additionally use Canvas for assignment submission and for posting rubrics for peer-grading.

### Course Details

**Course Description:** One of the most critical aspects of modern computer systems involves
interfacing with the world. This course will focus on how power-efficient user-facing systems
are built.

**Objective:** Students should learn the fundamentals of embedded system programming and feel
competent to design, build, and manufacture their own embedded devices. Furthermore,
students should understand how embedded systems interface with external peripheral devices.
Students should understand how application-specific blocks enable modern commercial devices.
Finally, students should understand how to design and build their own embedded systems
including printed-circuit board design and assembly.

**Outcome:** Students completing the course should be able to:

1. Identify the key blocks in an embedded system
2. Understand key aspects of embedded systems algorithms (interrupts, modules)
3. Understand standard serial communication protocols
4. Utilize software tools to program embedded devices
5. Utilize software tools to design printed circuit boards
6. Design, assemble, and program their own embedded devices
7. Exhibit creativity in designing, building, and programming a real-time sensor processing system

**Prerequisites:** ELEC220, ELEC326, COMP140. Also useful are 240 and 241.

**Grading:** Grades will be based on: 
  - __completion_ of approximately nine lab modules (40%)
  - a midterm project (20%)
  - a final project (30%), 
  - a skills matrix/class participation/in-class quizzes (10%). 
  - A number of extra credit options will be available throughout the semester for a maximum of 30% of the
    final grade. 

Late assignments may be accepted (with penalty), except for
printed circuit board orders, where late submissions may not be accepted.
Students wishing to submit late assignments should contact the instructor prior
to the due date.

**Honor code:**  You are encouraged to work **with** other students in ELEC327 on the labs. Each
student should turn in their own lab writeup. 
I would like you to write your own code and (especially) comments for the labs. If you share code 
or design elements with other students in the class you **MUST** cite
this in your returned assignments.
The midterm is expected to be done individually.
The final project will be done in groups with 1 set of materials turned in for the entire group.

**Prototyping Lab Cleanliness:**

Prototypihg tools are in the lab room FE&P 122B
Lab Access Keypad Code: .--- ----. ....- ---..#

Historically, the lab space has not been maintained in a neat and orderly manner.
Starting in 2025, we will implement spot inspections and **class-wide grade
deductions** to try to ensure that a high quality working and learning environment
is maintained.

**Waste:** In the process of learning how to assemble (i.e., solder) surface mount devices,
there has been not-insignificant waste, where things end up on the floor. While
we would prefer to avoid artificially limiting students supplies, we will do so
if waste is not contained.
