<h4 id="due-date-thursday-january-19-at-1159-pm">Due Date: <strong>Thursday, January 19 at 11:59 pm</strong></h4>

<h4 id="part-0-installation-optional">Part 0: Installation (optional)</h4>

<p>You are welcome to install TI’s <strong>Code Composer Studio</strong> (CCS) on your own personal computers. There are beta versions
available for both OSX and Linux, but in the past these have not supported all of the features
of the Windows version installed in lab. <a href="http://energia.nu/"><strong>Energia</strong></a> is a clone of the Arduino environment for
the MSP430. We will not use the Java-based approach used by Arduino, but the compiliing and
device programming components are still quite useful. Note that the Instructions for installing Energia can be
found at the project home page: <a href="http://energia.nu/">http://energia.nu/</a>. We will not
officially support Energia users in the class, however, we have found it to be quite usable in
a minimal sense.</p>

<h4 id="part-1-verify-ccsenergia-and-launchpad-functionality-and-examine-the-skeleton-code">Part 1: Verify CCS/Energia and Launchpad functionality and examine the skeleton code</h4>

<p>Compile the included <a href="lab1_skeleton.c">lab1_skeleton.c</a> file to verify that CCS is setup
correctly. (In Energia, you will need to create a new “sketch”, add a tab with the name lab1.c
or somesuch, erase the stuff in the first tab, and then code away in the second “.c” one.) You
should also read through this file: it shows the minimum amount of code needed to run the
MSP430 in an infinite loop. If you ever don’t know what some variable acronym means, look it
up! A useful practice is right clicking the name and going to “Open Declaration” (instructions
for CCS are in red). For instance, in this file, doing this on <code class="highlighter-rouge">CALBC\_1MHZ</code> brings you to:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">SFR\_8BIT(CALCBC1\_1MHZ)/\* BSCTL1 Calibration Data for 1 MHz \*/</code></p>

<p>And inspecting <code class="highlighter-rouge">BSTCTL1</code> shows:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">SFR\_8BIT(BCSCTL1)/\* Basic Clock System Control \*/</code></p>

<p>What, then, is the “clock system control” that is being referred to? Two resources you should
use extensively are the <a href="../assets/documents/slau144j_userguide.pdf">MSP430x2xx Family User Guide</a>
and the <a href="../assets/documents/msp430g2553.pdf">MSP430G2553 datasheet</a>, both of which can be found
on the main 327 page (or by googling). The user guide explains how to use various functions or
registers common to most MSP430s, while the data sheet has register values and pin information
specific to the G2553. So, searching for “BCSCTL1” on the user guide takes you to Chapter 5 and
Chapter 24, from which you can figure out that this line will set the frequency of the DCO to a
calibrated 1 MHz.</p>

<p>You’ll notice a function called “__delay_cycles” plays a major role. You will find that
documentation of this function is somehwat lacking on the internet. If you look in the <a href="http://elec327.github.io/lab1/assets/documents/slau132k.pdf">MSP430
Optimizing Compiler Guide</a>, you will see that it is not a C
function, but rather an “intrinsic”. In hindsight, if it’s role is to delay the processor a
precise number of cycles that can range from 1 to some large number, it could not be a function
(because calling a function takes more than one cycle!). A compiler intrinsic is something like
a macro - it is something that is replaced by appropriate code at compile time. In this case,
__delay_cycles is marked as deprecated, no doubt because its use leads to poor quality code
because it blocks the processor but still runs at full power. For this lab, however, you should
use it to achieve the defined results (except perhaps the bonus!).</p>

<h4 id="part-2-blinking-a-morse-code-message">Part 2: Blinking a Morse Code Message</h4>

<p>Using the P1.0 LED on your launchpad, blink a message in morse code. Look morse code up on
wikipedia to find the code for each letter and how to separate letters. Submit your code in a
separate file named <code class="highlighter-rouge">morse-code.c</code>. <strong>Every line should have a meaningful comment and extra
comments are welcome!</strong> A few specifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A “unit” should be ¼ of a second.</li>
  <li>Use whatever clock and Timer mode you want.</li>
  <li>Organize your code such that to change the message, you only have to change one array at the
beginning of your program (this should be an array of Morse code “dots” and “dashes”).</li>
  <li>Be able to display either “SOS” or 3 other letters (i.e., your initials, the first 3 letters
of your first name, etc), depending on which array is commented out.</li>
  <li>Your message should repeat.</li>
  <li>Consider repetitions of your message different words. This means that you should have 7
“units” of off time between each repetition. If you want, this as well as spaces between
letters and parts of the same letter can be hard coded into your array.</li>
  <li>To help yourself write clean code, you should use “BITx” whenever you do anything with a pin
on the MSP430.</li>
  <li><strong>BONUS [High Speed]:</strong> For those of you feeling particularly under-tasked by this lab, extra
credit will be given for a second implementation of code that runs as fast as possible.
Specifically, the goal is to minimize the “dot” time (the “dash” should be twice the dot).
You can use any and all tricks at your disposal (i.e., changing clock frequency, using
timers, etc), and should demonstrate the result using an oscilloscope.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="part-3-moving-it-to-a-breadboard">Part 3: Moving it to a Breadboard</h4>

<p>We’ll be working with a lot of input/output devices in this class, and so it makes sense to be
able to program an MSP430 on a breadboard so that it can run independently. Make this
breadboard wiring clean, as you’ll be testing a lot of circuits using it. To actually program
the MSP430 on a breadboard using the launchpad, you only need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Connect the TEST and RST pins on the EMULATION side of the launchpad to their respective
pins on the MSP430 (these are labeled on the launchpad where the MSP430 itself is usually
located).</li>
  <li>Connect Vcc and GND (or some independent battery, but for now use the launchpad’s power) to
their respective pins. For your convenience, jump these to the power lines on the
breadboard. To ensure a clean power supply to the MSP430, connect a 10uF capacitor anywhere on
the board between Vcc and GND.</li>
  <li>Connect a pull-up resistor to the RST pin, as it is active-low. That is, connect a large
resistor (47K from lab is fine) from the RST pin to Vcc, to ensure that its default state is
high.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, reproduce your morse code circuit on the breadboard using LEDs and resistors in the lab.
There are, however, some differences you need to take into account – <strong>see questions 8-10!</strong>
Wire the circuit on your breadboard, and successfully program it.</p>

<h4 id="video">Video</h4>

<p>Create a demo video showing your breadboarded system successfully flashing. You should show
your code/breadboard running “SOS” and film the process of reprogramming it to display your
other 3-letter string (or vice versa). Put a link to the video at the beginning of your answers
to the questions.</p>

<h4 id="questions-10-pts-each">Questions (10 pts each):</h4>

<p>Please reference your answers to one of the authoritative sources.</p>

<p><em>Questions from week 1 of class:</em></p>

<ol class="questions" start="1">
<li>What are the arguments for ALU instructions? How big (in bits) is the memory address space?
What is the minimum size of memory that can be addressed? Would you describe the MSP430g2553
CPU as 8 bit or 16 bit?</li>
<li>What is the difference between the "indexed" and "indirect
register" addressing mode</li>
<li>What is the largest (i.e. most memory bytes used) possible operation?</li>
<li>What is the longest (i.e. most clock cycles) possible operation?</li>
<li>What is the maximum operating voltage for the MSP430g2553? What is the maximum operating
frequency? What is the minimum operating voltage to run at 16 MH?</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Questions from the skeleton code:</em></p>

<ol class="questions" start="8">
<li>In the initial skeleton code, what is the frequency and period of the LED? (up to 50 bonus
points for ridiculously accurate responses)</li>
<li>If you wanted to slow down the flashing of the LED in the skeleton code, how could you do
it?</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Questions from bread-boarding:</em></p>

<ol class="questions" start="10">
<li>What is the forward voltage on the LED? What is its maximum forward current?</li>
<li>What is the supply voltage coming out of the MSP430? On the MSP430G2553, what is the
maximum current any one pin can output?</li>
<li>Using all this, what is the resistor value you should use to supply exactly this maximum
current? To be safe when using the MSP430, should you use a larger or smaller resistor?</li>
</ol>
