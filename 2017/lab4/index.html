<h4 id="part-1-multiple-timers-program-structure">Part 1: Multiple Timers, Program Structure</h4>

<p>For Lab 2, you figured out how to run your MSP430 in Low Power Mode. In order to make your mood
ring, you’ll need to properly architect your code. To begin with, think about the different
time scales at which you want to act:</p>

<ol class="questions">
  <li>For optimal power, which clock should you use for PWM? Ideally the PWM control frequency
  should be one or two orders of magnitude higher than the minimum (let’s say &gt; 5 kHz). How would
  you set the PWM control clock to run at 6 kHz?</li>
  <li>The MSP430G2553 has 3 timer modules –two are the TimerA type, and one is the Watchdog Timer
  (WDT+). Unlike the TimerA module, the WDT+ module cannot control PWM outputs and has less
  flexibility in general. However, it is very useful as a tool to trigger low level state
  changes. How would you configure the WDT+ module to generate periodic (maskable)
  interrupts?</li>
  <li>If your <code class="highlighter-rouge">main()</code> function contains an instruction which puts the CPU into a low power mode,
  what are the minimal interrupt service routine instructions required to wake the CPU and return
  function to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">main()</code> function?</li>
</ol>

<p>You can either use two separate LEDs or an RGB LED unit soldered to a breakout board for the
rest of Part 1. Modify your code from Lab 2 so that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">main()</code> function adjusts the PWM
parameters to increase the brightness of the blue LED and decrease the brightness of the red
LED through 16 levels (so that maximum blue corresponds with minimum red and vice versa). Your
<code class="highlighter-rouge">main()</code> function should be an infinite loop, with a command to go into low power mode at the end
of each color shift cycle. Set up the WDT+ module to generate an interrupt every second to wake
up the CPU, so that the shifts in color happen every second.</p>

<ol class="questions" start="4">
  <li>Assuming you use the VLO to control the WDT and TimerA modules, what is the lowest
  LPM which will allow your device to continue to function?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Save this code as timer_shift_PWM.c.</strong> You will create a demo video which contains both the
timer-shifted colors and temperature shifted colors.</p>

<h4 id="part-2-making-a-mood-ring">Part 2: Making a Mood Ring</h4>

<p>In this part, we’ll put together Part 1 and add in ADC to make a “mood ring” with the RGB LED
(ignoring the green part) controlled by the on board temperature sensor. We’ll start off with a
few questions that should guide learning how to use ADC:</p>

<ol class="questions" start="5">
  <li>How would you turn on the ADC10 module and tell it to sample from the internal temperature
  sensor? What is the default voltage range for conversion?</li>
  <li>What are two ways of discovering when the ADC10 module has finished a conversion? Which
  method will be more efficient from a power perspective?</li>
  <li>What is the minimum sampling period for the internal temperature sensor on the ADC10
  module? Assuming that you run the ADC10 using the VLO at 12 kHz, what is the maximum sampling
  rate for temperature?</li>
  <li>What kind of ADC is used in the MSP430? Take a look at the <a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-42181-SAM-D21_Datasheet.pdf">datasheet for the Atmel SAM
  D21</a>, which is used in the
  Arduino One. What type of ADC architecture do you think it uses (hint: take a look at the
  “Conversion Timing” in the ADC section)?</li>
  <li>Assume you’ve already maximized the sampling clock and minimized the hold time. If you
  could make an architecturatl change to increase the rate at which samples were acquired by
  the MSP430 ADC10, how could you do it? Is there a simple modification that would let users
  trade off bit depth for sampling rate (hint: the SAM D21 has this feature)?</li>
  <li>In an oversampling ADC, what multiple of the sampling rate yields an additional bit of
  precision? In a sigma-delta ADC, what multiple of the sampling rate yields an additional bit
  of precision?</li>
</ol>

<p>Modify your <code class="highlighter-rouge">main()</code> function so that the code goes into low power mode twice: after enabling
the ADC10 to sample and after changing the PWM parameters for the LEDs. Set up your ISRs for
the ADC10 and WDT interrupts to return control to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">main()</code> function, with the WDT interrupt
executing at 4 Hz. Once you receive a sample temperature, you should scale your LED output so
that cold will be fully blue and hot will be fully red. (You can play around with “hot” and
“cold” values, try to get them to a range where if you warm your hands and touch the MSP it’s
“hot” and if you don’t touch it for a while or actively cool it it’s “cold”.)This is now the
code for your “mood ring” on your breadboard. Make sure to comment your code in detail, such
that any design decisions you made are easily available (which components are on which pins,
label interval for timers in ms, etc). <strong>Save this code as <code class="highlighter-rouge">mood_ring.c</code>. Create a demo video that
shows the timer-shifting colors from Part 1 and temperature shifting color from Part 2. For
Part 2, you should start with your device at one extreme, change it to the other, and then let
it return. Upload your answered questions, code and the video URL to Canvas.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Add a “heart-beat” functionality to your mood ring where the LEDs flash at 0.5 Hz,
but rather than flashing, become dimmer and brighter smoothly, with the color corresponding to
the temperature.</p>
