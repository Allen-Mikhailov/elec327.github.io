## Final Project: Closed-Loop Low-Power Embedded Systems

#### Final Project Goals
The goal for the final project is to create a low-power embedded system that interacts with the
world in an interesting way. In previous years, we have focused on motion as a means to
requiring the tight timing that bare-metal embedded systems can provide.

#### Logistics
You should work in teams of between 2 and 4. The project will be due on the last day of finals.

#### Instructions and rubric
Please put together a written report, 2-3 pages, which includes a description of your concept
and actual design. Include pedagogical information about any sensors or special devices you
have used. Diagrams, pictures, and drawings are welcome. In addition, create two videos, one
longer, formed as a presentation (i.e., with slides) of your design and implementation, and one
shorter (two minutes or less - functioning as a brief advertisement) mainly focusing on showing
off your functioning product. For extra credit, create a GitHub project (for your code and
other design files) and associated website which has the written presentation content. On
Canvas, submit either a link to this site or your written presentation, your code, and links

You will be graded on:
  + the quality of your presentation (written and oral). Do you do a good job of explaining
  your system concept and architecture? Do you include pedagogical content that will educate
  listeners on specific sensors or actuators that you used? Is it enjoyable to watch/listen to?
  + the quality of your design concept. Does it match the capabilities of the MSP430 in its complexity, 
  real-time processing, and low-power requirements? Is it interesting/fun?
  + the quality of your execution on this concept. Does your final product match the vision
  that you described? Does the actual device (including PCB and other parts) seem polished?
  + the quality of your code and system architecture. Does your system architecture reflect
  concepts we cover in class (low power modes, hardware modules, timers, PWM, etc)? Is your
  code well thought out and well commented? Is your hardware (i.e., PCB/circuit) well designed?


#### Lame-O Backup project
If you are struggling to come up with a project, I have designed and manufactured PCBs that could
be used to play Tic-Tac-Toe. You may optionally choose to take one of these PCBs and write the code
for the game on it.
