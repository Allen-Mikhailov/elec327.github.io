    <p>Deep brain stimulation is an FDA-approved treatment for Parkinson’s disease and essential
tremors. As the name implies, DBS therapy involves the implantation of electrodes into
structures deep in the brain (“deep” as opposed to surface or non-invasive transcranial
stimulation, and “brain” as opposed to stimulation of peripheral nerves). As shown in the
picture to the left, A DBS system comprises to elements - the electrodes which are implanted
into the brain and deliver charge to the tissue, and the “implanted pulse generator” (IPG)
which contains a battery and generates and controls the stimulation pulses.  In this course, we
have been studying the implementation of small, low power embedded systems. An IPG is an
excellent example of a very specialized embedded system which must be both small and ulta-low
power. The goal of this lab is for you to learn more about devices which interface with the
nervous system and to consider the design of an IPG.</p>

Reviews in Bioengineering</em> 2012</a>. If you are interested in learning more about
the mechanisms of DBS in Parkinson’s disease, a good review is <a href="Johnson2008.pdf">Johnson et al,

<h4 id="exercises-10-pts-each">Exercises (10 pts each)</h4>
<ol class="questions">
  <li>Read this <a href="Moore2006.pdf">IEEE Spectrum article from 2006</a>. What are two stimulation therapies
  that are FDA approved for treating depression. What are two other therapies that are being
  tested for efficacy in depressed patients (as of 2006 - note that AFAIK, these tests are
  on-going).</li>
  <li>Read this <a href="Denison2015.pdf">IEEE Spectrum article from 2015</a> for background. To
  treat seizures, Company A and Company B both have systems which control stimulation in “closed
  loop”, i.e., in response to some detected signature. Assume the Company A system is measuring
  variability in heartrate, and the Company B system is measuring the spectral power in a “local
  field potential” rhythm with a center frequency of ~30 Hz. Which system do you think requires
  more power for data acquisition and why? Which system do you think requires more power for
  signal processing? Which system do you think will have lower latency?</li>
  <li>Let’s try to reverse engineer the power consumption of a commercial IPG. For this and the next
  question, make reference to <a href="MedtronicIPGManual.pdf">this programming manual
  for some of the Medtronic IPGs</a>. Look at the energy use data in Table 13 (for the Kinetra
  system from Medtronic). If the device consumes some ammount of constant power (due to digital
  blocks) plus some amount of variable power depending on stimulation intensity, we would expect
  the increase in energy consumption with increasing stimulation current and pulse width to rise
  with a slope of approximately one. Is that what you observe? Why might this not be the case?</li>
  <li>Some dystonias are treated with DBS at 40 Hz rather than the standard 130 Hz for Parkinson’s
  disease. What would you expect the difference in battery life to be between the two conditions
  for a Kinetra stimulator set to 5 mA stimulation and 60 us pulse widths (continuous
  stimulation)?</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="design-study-70-pts">Design Study (70 pts)</h4>

<p>Below is the schematic for a simple MSP430-based system for delivering constant-current
stimulation (i.e., an IPG). Your task is to evaluate the design using your knowledge of the
MSP430 and by reading the data sheets for the two other integrated circuits, the <a href="DS4432.pdf">current-mode
digital to analog converter (DS4432)</a> and the <a href="TS3A4751.pdf">digitally-controlled switch
(TS3A4751)</a>.</p>

<p><img src="DBSSchematic.png" alt="DBS Schematic" /></p>

<p>The goal of the IPG is to deliver biphasic current pulses, as shown below, with a programmable
frequency and current amplitude.</p>

<p><img src="BiphasicPulse.png" alt="Biphasic Pulses" /></p>

<p>For the purposes of this lab, you can
assume that we want 130 Hz stimulation and 50 μA pulses with 60 μs pulse width. The DS4432 is a
digitally-controlled current source, but cannot generate biphasic pulses. In order to generate
biphasic pulses the design relies on a switch matrix as in Figure 4 in <a href="Farahmand2012.pdf">Farahamand
2012</a>. Even though the data sheet does not specify this, you may assume that
the amount of time the DS4432 requires to turn on is equivalent to the amount of time it takes
to transmit the relevant I2C commmands. In addition, assume you are running with a 3V battery.</p>

<p>For the second part of the lab, in about 2/3rds of a page,</p>

<ol class="questions">
  <li>Outline the structure of code that would create the desired stimulation pattern, including
    if/when the MSP430 would be in low power mode, when/how the switch matrix is activated, and
    when/how the current generator is configured. What clock frequency would the MSP430 run at
    when in active mode (take into account the clock cycles required to trigger a GPIO!)? ((30 pts)</li>
  <li>Summarize the average power consumption of your design by adding up power for each of the 3
    devices (with time spent in relevant power modes for the MSP430). What size battery (in mA
    hours) would you need to run for 1 year? (30 pts)</li>
  <li>Could you change the circuit to lower the power consumption? (10 pts)</li>
</ol>
