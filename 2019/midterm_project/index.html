<p>The game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)">“Simon”</a> is a classic toy which tests the
working memory of the player. For the midterm project, you will create a small,
coin cell-operated Simon game. This will involve PCB design and fairly involved firmware to
acheive an enjoyable user experience. In addition, you will be invited to add some sort of
interesting feature beyond the Simon game. In the past, this has ranged from simple animations
to a mode in which the device becomes a music sequencer.</p>

<p>Here’s a video from Vitor Azevedo Andriotti (Spring 2015) showing a Simon board in action.</p>

<h4 id="rules-for-the-the-elec327-version-of-the-simon-game">Rules for the The ELEC327 version of the Simon game</h4>

<p>In our variant of Simon, the point of the game is to learn a sequence of <em>M</em> button presses.
Each button corresponds to one of the LEDs and to one frequency of PWM tone. On the <em>n</em>th turn,
the device plays the first <em>n</em> elements of the sequence. So one tone/LED on turn one, two on
turn two, etc. The pattern of the <em>n-1</em> elements of the sequence are the same as the previous
turn. Each turn, after the sequence is played, the player must push the appropriate buttons to
recreate the sequence. If they do it correctly, the game proceeds to the <em>n+1</em>th turn. If they
make an error or wait too long (measured by the time since the last button press), they lose.
Winning corresponds to playing the full <em>M</em>-element sequence. If the player loses, the device
should play a “Game Over - Lost” animation that continues until it is reset. Similarly, if the
player wins, the device should play a “Game Over - Won” animation until it is reset (e.g., by
power cycling or pressing a button).</p>

<p>Details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On initial boot, the devices should play either one of the “Game Over” animations or a
third novel animation. Pushing any button should then start the game.</li>
  <li>Sequences should be random each game (make sure your random routine produces a different
value on startup!)</li>
  <li>When a button is pressed, the appropriate LED should flash (and tone should sound).</li>
  <li>The timeout period should not be a constant. Rather, each time a player pushes a button, a
new timeout should start. Thus, a timeout of 1-2 s is appropriate.</li>
  <li>Errors should result in immediate game over (i.e., button presses should be processed
immediately).</li>
  <li>You should make the maximum sequence size adjustable. For your video, sequences of length 5
are appropriate.</li>
  <li>You are expected to implement software debouncing (and don’t use capacitors with switches!)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-simon-pcb">The Simon PCB</h4>

<p>The first thing you must turn in is a layout of the Simon PCB. There is a hard upper limit on
size of 3 in. x 3 in., but the physical board will be graded on a combination of small size and
ergonomics. Parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 buttons (with capacitors just in case you can’t figure out software debouncing)</li>
  <li>4 APA102 SPI RGB LEDs (probably either in a row or in a circle)</li>
  <li>Power switch</li>
  <li>AAA battery pack (mounted to the back - not connector polarity)</li>
  <li>Piezo buzzer (wired up for PWM - see Lab 8)</li>
</ul>

<p>These parts are given in the
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ckemere/ELEC327/master/Labs/Midterm/Simon.sch">Simon.sch</a>
Eagle CAD schematic in the ELEC327 git repository.</p>

<p><em>Note that you are not <strong>limited</strong> to the listed parts. You can add additional parts from the
list above or other lab supplies, but if you do, you are expected to demo their utility as part
of your project!</em></p>
